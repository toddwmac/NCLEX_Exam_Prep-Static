# Fundamentals of Nursing Study Guide

## 📋 Overview
Fundamentals of nursing encompasses the basic concepts and skills that form the foundation of nursing practice. This guide covers essential principles, basic skills, and core nursing concepts. For more advanced clinical applications, see our [Medical-Surgical Guide](/materials/study-guide/med-surg).

## 🎯 NCLEX Priority Topics
These topics frequently appear on the NCLEX exam:

### Safety & Infection Control
- Hand hygiene and aseptic technique
- Standard precautions vs. transmission-based precautions
- Safe patient handling and transfer
- Fall risk assessment and prevention
- Medication administration safety

### Basic Care & Comfort
- Activities of daily living (ADLs)
- Pain assessment and management
- Sleep and rest promotion
- Nutrition and hydration
- Elimination needs

### Documentation & Communication
- SBAR reporting
- Legal documentation requirements
- Electronic health records
- Patient education principles

## 📚 Study Strategies
Use these techniques to master fundamental concepts:

1. **Concept Mapping**
   - Create visual connections between related topics
   - Link assessment findings to nursing diagnoses
   - Connect interventions to expected outcomes

2. **Mnemonics for Key Concepts**
   - ADPIE (Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Implementation, Evaluation)
   - OLDCARTS (Onset, Location, Duration, Characteristics, Aggravating factors, Relieving factors, Timing, Severity)
   - Rights of Medication Administration

3. **Skills Practice Checklist**
   - Practice skills in sequence
   - Verbalize steps while performing
   - Use simulation when available
   - Get peer feedback

- [ ] Basic Documentation

*For normal vital sign ranges and lab values, see our [Lab Values Quick Reference](/materials/quick-reference/lab-values).*

## 💭 Critical Thinking Exercises
1. **Case Study: New Patient Admission**
   > A 78-year-old patient is admitted with decreased mobility and poor appetite. What are your priority assessments and interventions?
   
   *Key considerations:*
   - Fall risk assessment
   - Nutritional status
   - Skin integrity
   - Mobility level

2. **NCLEX-Style Question Practice**
   > A nurse is caring for multiple patients. Which situation requires immediate action?
   - A. Patient with stable vital signs requesting pain medication
   - B. Patient with a blood pressure of 82/50 mmHg
   - C. Patient requesting assistance to the bathroom
   - D. Patient complaining of hunger before scheduled meal time
   
   *Answer: B - Low blood pressure requires immediate intervention*
   
   **Rationale:** Learn to identify priority situations using the ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) approach.

*Test your knowledge with our [Practice Questions](/practice).*

## ✅ Study Tips for Success
**Active Learning Techniques**
- Create flashcards for vital signs ranges
- Practice writing care plans
- Role-play patient scenarios
- Use study groups for skills practice

**Test-Taking Strategies**
- Look for keywords: immediate, priority, first, best
- Apply Maslow's Hierarchy to prioritize care
- Consider patient safety first
- Use the nursing process to organize your thinking
